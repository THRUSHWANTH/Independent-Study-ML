# Predicting University Graduation Rates: A Comparative Analysis of ML Regression Models

Welcome to the Predicting University Graduation Rates Project! This independent study, conducted as part of the Master of Professional Studies in Data Science program at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, focuses on constructing machine learning and deep learning models to predict graduation rates at four-year institutions. The project aims to enhance predictive capabilities for educational outcomes, identify influential features, assess and compare regression models, and empower stakeholders with actionable insights.

## Problem Statement
The landscape of higher education demands scrutiny for institutional effectiveness and student success, with graduation rates serving as pivotal benchmarks. This study endeavors to contribute to academic understanding and empower stakeholders with actionable insights to improve institutional effectiveness and student success.

## Objectives
1. Enhance predictive capabilities for graduation rates at four-year institutions, focusing on "C100_4," "C150_4," and "C200_4" variables.
2. Identify influential features affecting graduation rates.
3. Assess and compare regression models to guide future analyses in higher education.
4. Empower policymakers and institutions with actionable insights for informed decision-making.

## Feature Selection and Importance Analysis
The project utilized distribution analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify features with significant predictive potential. Noteworthy features include Pell Grant Rate, Average SAT Scores, Out-of-State Tuition, Median Student Debt, Non-Traditional Student Percentage, Average Faculty Salary, Undergraduate Enrollment, Average 4-Year Program Cost, Overall Admission Rate, and Percentage of Asian Students.

## Comparative Performance of Predictive Models
Here's a snapshot of the comparative analysis of various models:

| Model | Train R2 | Test R2 | Train MSE | Test MSE |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Linear | 0.75 | 0.74 | 0.0077 | 0.0078 |
| Polynomial With Lasso | 0.78 | 0.77 | 0.006 | 0.007 |
| Decision Tree Tuned | 0.83 | 0.81 | 0.005 | 0.005 |
| Random Forest | 0.81 | 0.76 | 0.005 | 0.007 |
| RNN LSTM Tuned | 0.85 | 0.84 | 0.004 | 0.005 |

## Evaluating Model Performance: A Closer Look
Detailed analyses were conducted on key models, such as RNN LSTM, Decision Tree Regression, XGBoost Tuned, and Polynomial with Lasso. Each model's strengths, weaknesses, and tuning strategies were discussed.

## Conclusion
- The RNN LSTM Tuned model excelled with robust train and test R2 scores near 85%.
- Key influencers on graduation rates include financial aid and academic metrics.
- Comparative analyses highlighted the strengths of models like XGBoost, Decision Tree, Polynomial with Lasso, and Random Forest.
- Opportunities for further improvements in the RNN LSTM model were identified, suggesting the potential integration of advanced techniques like attention mechanisms.
- The findings equip education stakeholders with actionable insights for strategic planning to boost student success and institutional performance.
